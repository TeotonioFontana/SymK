# IaaC Recovery Suite — Product Vision

## 1. Problem / Opportunity

Modern AWS environments are:

- Spread across multiple accounts, regions, and services.
- Backed up in fragments (snapshots here, AMIs there, S3 dumps somewhere else).
- Poorly validated: backups exist, but nobody is sure they are complete, restorable, or compliant.

When a real incident happens (region outage, ransomware, fat-fingered delete):

- Teams scramble across consoles, CLI profiles, and half-maintained scripts.
- Recovery plans are tribal knowledge, not codified.
- Management only discovers the **real RTO/RPO** when it’s too late.

**Opportunity:** provide a **coherent, automated, provable** way to:

- Orchestrate backups (snapshots, full-volume imaging, manifests).
- Validate backup completeness and recoverability.
- Support repeatable, low-friction disaster-recovery exercises.
- Produce **evidence** that satisfies internal and external auditors.

## 2. Who We Serve (Segments)

Primary segments:

- **Cloud / Platform Engineers**
  Responsible for backup, DR runbooks, and infrastructure automation.

- **SRE / Operations Teams**
  On the hook for availability, incident response, and post-mortems.

- **Security / Compliance Officers**
  Need auditable proof that backups and DR processes meet policies and standards.

Secondary segments:

- **CTO / Head of Engineering**
  Want reduced recovery risk and clear visibility, without micromanaging every script.

- **External Auditors / Regulators**
  Consume reports and evidence rather than operating the tools.

---

## 3. Desired Future State

With IaaC Recovery Suite in place:

- Backups are **policy-driven and orchestrated**, not ad-hoc scripts.
- Every backup run produces **structured manifests** and logs that can be inspected and replayed.
- Disaster recovery is **rehearsed**, not theoretical:
  - Teams can simulate region loss or account compromise in a controlled way.
  - Recovery paths are documented, testable, and repeatable.
- Recovery risk is **quantified**:
  - Gaps and misconfigurations are detected and reported proactively.
- Evidence for audits is **one command away**, not a three-week project.

In short: the organization has **confidence** that it can lose an AWS region and still stand back up in a controlled, documented way.

## 4. Why Now

- Cloud estates are growing in complexity; manual DR scripts don’t scale.
- Regulatory and contractual pressure (e.g. DR tests, RTO/RPO commitments) is increasing.
- Ransomware, supply-chain attacks, and “oops, we deleted prod” events are no longer edge cases.
- Many organizations already have bits and pieces (snapshots, some S3 backups), but **no unifying layer** that:
  - Coordinates backups,
  - Validates them,
  - And produces audit-ready evidence.

IaaC Recovery Suite meets a **timely need**: turn fragmented, fragile backup scripts into a **structured recovery capability**.

## 5. What “Winning” Looks Like

Qualitative success indicators:

- DR exercises become **routine** and boring rather than chaotic.
- Engineers trust the tooling more than their private scripts.
- Management sees **clear, simple dashboards/reports** about recovery posture.
- Audits stop being multi-week archaeological expeditions.

Quantitative success (refined in `success_criteria.md`):

- Time to assemble evidence for an audit reduced by X%.
- Time to execute a DR drill reduced by Y%.
- Number of backup / recovery gaps detected **before** incidents increases (and then trends down as posture improves).
- Coverage of critical workloads by orchestrated backups approaches 100%.

## 6. High-Level Feature Themes

These are **themes**, not backlog tickets. They will be refined and prioritized later in Planning (3.x).

1. **Backup Orchestration & Manifests**
   - Consistent orchestration of EBS snapshots, AMIs, S3 copies, and metadata.
   - Per-run manifests describing exactly what was backed up, where, and under which policies.

2. **Recovery Audit & Gap Analysis**
   - Tools to inspect the backup repository (e.g. S3) and detect missing or inconsistent artifacts.
   - Gaps reported with clear severity and remediation hints.

3. **DR Simulation & Rehearsals**
   - Ability to simulate region/account loss **without** touching production.
   - Scripts/pipelines that stand up representative recovery environments using existing artifacts.

4. **Compliance & Evidence Layer**
   - Reports and exportable artifacts tailored for internal and external audits.
   - Traceability from policies → runs → manifests → reports.

5. **SymK-Style AI Assistance (Optional Initially)**
   - AI support to summarize posture, highlight risky areas, and suggest improvements.
   - AI-generated natural-language summaries for management and auditors, backed by structured data.

## 7. Alignment & Traceability

This Product Vision is **upstream** of:

- `1.2 Market Research` — segments, alternatives, and detailed opportunities.
- `1.3 Stakeholder Map` — who cares about which outcomes and constraints.
- `2.x Architecture` — reference stacks for helper instances, networking, IAM, observability.
- `3.x Planning` — feature slicing, RICE scoring, and release planning.

Every major feature, epic, or architectural decision for IaaC Recovery Suite should trace back to:

- Problem / opportunity statements in this document.
- Jobs / feature themes in `product_vision.json`.
- Success criteria defined in `success_criteria.md`.

If a feature cannot be traced back here, we either:

- Update the Product Vision (if the world changed), or
- Admit the feature is likely noise and should be challenged.
